When Arc 3.1 loads, the "TZ" system environment variable is set to be ":GMT" so
that Arc's 'timedate function can return a value that's independent of the
system's time zone.

In the time since that code was written, Racket has added a parameter to its
`seconds->time` function that makes the result consistently based on UTC time.
Anarki now avoids modifying the "TZ" environment variable and uses Racket's
direct support instead.

This is not an invisible change. In particular, it may have a noticeable impact
on Arc code that uses (system ...) calls like (system "date") that are sensitive
to the "TZ" environment variable, since the value they see will be unmodified.
